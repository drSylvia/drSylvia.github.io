# Visit members’ mine sites in the Gunnedah Basin
It’s fantastic to have the opportunity to visit members’ mine sites in the Gunnedah Basin to learn about their production operations. On-the-job learning experiences – hearing first-hand about day-to-day operations and coming back to the office to share insights with the rest of our team – are invaluable for ensuring that we continue providing the best possible customer service.

# Raising funds for Variety - the Children's Charity NSW/ACT
The HVCCC had a competitive day raising funds for Variety - the Children's Charity NSW/ACT – Spin4Kids 2023 event on 23 March.
 
In between completing our normal work, our long-term fundraiser for Variety - Guy Finn - coordinated all of us to have an intensely fun day – thanks Guy!
 
This is another way of the HVCCC team contributing to our charity partners and having some fitness fun.
