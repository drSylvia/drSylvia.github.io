## Industry experience using C and Python
Excel+SQL+Python
I worked as a data analyst at Samsung and Lenovo China, mainly responsible for Data analysis and report writing. The types of data I analyze mainly include: home appliance online business data (Samsung), and Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) Logistics Operations date (Lenovo). The main analysis tool used at that time was Excel+SQL+Python. For enterprise data analysis, especially supply chain data presentation, we mainly use Microsoft Power BI.

Python + C + HPC
During my Ph.D. period, I used Python and C for model solving and Python for data analysis. I also use python to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. 

In my graduation thesis, I compared the computational efficiency and quality of algorithms written in python and C. The code written in C is more efficient, for some specific scenarios, the calculation speed and result quality are higher than commercial software GUROBI. My Python and C language skills can fully support further scientific research. 

## Code repositories
Tracking tools - I use GIT + Latex for all code and latex tracking. 

## Supply Chain Management Related Software
HPC - I am proficient in high performance computing (HPC) process data and perform complex calculations.
ERP - I used SAP as the ERP management tool when I was working at Samsung. 
Project management - Use Jira as internal team project management tools. 
CRM + real-time data analysis tools - Dynamics 365 + Power BI (University of Newcastle)
Drawing â€“ Viso, Matplotlib
Vensim - developing, analyzing, and packaging dynamic feedback models
