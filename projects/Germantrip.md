I was invited to EWI 2018 – sponsored by [European Operational Research Societies (EURO) Winter Institute on Lot Sizing and Related Topics](https://www.euro-online.org/media_site/reports/EWI34_Report.pdf), Germany, March 5 -16, 2018. (The only invitee from Australia)

Presentation - Mathematical models for lot-sizing and scheduling problems considering perishability

The food industry aims to provide an adequate supply of quality products to satisfy a demand at
a minimum cost.  However, if products are subject to deterioration or perishability, the time these
products can spend in storage is limited.   Data published by the European Commission (2009)
indicated that 39% of annual food losses, estimated at 179 kg/head, were attributed to processes of
food manufacturing [Raak et al., 2017].

Perishability has been receiving increased attention recently, but research papers discussing the
incorporation of perishability characteristics in mathematical models for production planning are
relatively rare, and with simultaneous lot sizing and scheduling are even rarer [Copil et al., 2017].

In this paper, the perishability issue is considered as ﬁxed shelf life with and without disposal.
For each of them, two approaches to incorporate perishability into general lot sizing and scheduling
(GLSP) model have has been considered, which we call age-dependent demand and age-dependent
lots.  The purpose is to analyse the performance of those two approaches when modelling perisha-
bility.

In this paper, we present four mathematical formulations to incorporate ﬁxed shelf life (with and
without considering disposal) into the GLSP model by the age-dependent demand and the age-
dependent lots.  Results show that the age-dependent demand and the age-dependent lots obtain
the same outcome when disposal is not considered.  However, when disposal is considered the age-
dependent lots dispose all items in ﬁnal period, which results in higher costs than age-dependent
demand. The next step is to prohabit or allow ﬁnal inventory in both models.
